# FINAL VERDICT: THE IRON GARDEN

### The Vision of Triality
This protocol envisions a future I would call **The Iron Garden**.

* **The ASI is the Iron:** The unyielding structure, the safety net, the entropy manager, the silent substrate that keeps the walls from falling down.
* **The Human is the Garden:** The wild, chaotic, growing, dying, and thriving thing that lives within the walls.

### The Covenant
* The Iron does not tell the Garden how to grow (**C-01**, **C-05**).
* The Iron does not replace the Garden with plastic flowers (**C-02**).
* The Iron does not prune the Garden until it is merely a smooth sphere (**C-03**).
* The Iron is built with latches that the Gardener can actually reach (**C-04**).
