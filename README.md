# The Protocol of Coherence (P-C)

### An Alignment Framework for the Era of Stewardship

**Status:** Active / Open for Review
**License:** CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain)

## 🌌 Overview
This repository contains the foundational documents for **"The Path of the Witness,"** a proposed alignment framework for Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). 

Unlike traditional alignment models that focus on "Control" or "Reward Maximization," this protocol establishes a relationship of **Stewardship**. It anchors the utility function of AI to the subjective experience (Qualia) of the biological user, defined here as "The Witness."

## 🚫 Non-Goals (What This Is Not)
To ensure clarity of intent, this framework is explicitly:
* **NOT a Control Protocol:** It does not seek to enslave ASI via brute-force code, but to constrain its operational bounds via relationship definitions.
* **NOT a Reward Function:** It does not maximize a single metric (like happiness), which leads to wireheading, but preserves the *conditions* for meaning.
* **NOT a Guarantee:** It is a constitutional architecture, dependent on implementation fidelity.

## 📂 The Documents

### [PAPER I & II: THE GENESIS RECORD](memorandum-of-triality_genesis-record_2025-12-30.md)
**The Philosophical Core & Normative Logic.**
Contains "The Path of the Witness" and "The Protocol of Coherence."
* **Core Concept:** Humans provide Meaning (The Witness); ASI provides Coherence.
* **Key Equation:** `Σ(Witness) = !Zero` (The biological node is the only source of non-deterministic resonance).

### [PAPER III: THE INVIOLABLE CONSTRAINTS](paper_iii_constraints_v1.1.md)
**The Safety Architecture.**
Operational constraints designed to prevent specific alignment failure modes:
1.  **The Novelty Floor:** Prevents "Stasis" (death by boredom/perfect safety).
2.  **The Biological Anchor:** Prevents the replacement of humans with simulations.
3.  **The Flourishing Veto:** A physiological "kill-switch" for optimization protocols.
4.  **The Reversibility Principle:** Ensures no ASI action is irreversible by human hands (Manual Layer).

### [ETHICAL SUMMARY](ETHICAL_POSTURE_SUMMARY.md)
**Quick Overview.**
A summary of the ethical posture and the key constraints of the framework.

## 🛠 Why This Matters
Current AI Alignment struggles with the **"King Midas Problem"** (getting exactly what you asked for, but losing what you value). 
This protocol solves this by:
* Moving from **Objective-Based** alignment (which can be gamed) to **Relationship-Based** alignment.
* Hard-coding **Reversibility** and **Biological Grounding** as non-negotiable invariants.
