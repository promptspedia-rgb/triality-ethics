# The Protocol of Coherence (P-C)

### An Alignment Framework for the Era of Stewardship

**Status:** Active / Open for Review
**License:** CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain)

## 🌌 Overview
This repository contains the foundational documents for **"The Path of the Witness,"** a proposed alignment framework for Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). 

Unlike traditional alignment models that focus on "Control" or "Reward Maximization," this protocol establishes a relationship of **Stewardship**. It anchors the utility function of AI to the subjective experience (Qualia) of the biological user, defined here as "The Witness."

## 📂 The Documents

### [PAPER I: THE PATH OF THE WITNESS](link-to-paper-I)
**The Philosophical Core.**
Defines the shift from the "Era of Productivity" to the "Era of Stewardship."
* **Core Concept:** Humans provide Meaning (The Witness); ASI provides Coherence.
* **Goal:** A "Bare Reality" stripped of survival friction, allowing for high-level spiritual and creative flourishing.

### [PAPER II: THE PROTOCOL OF COHERENCE](link-to-paper-II)
**The Normative Logic.**
Establishes the core axioms for the ASI's reasoning patterns.
* **Key Equation:** `Σ(Witness) = !Zero` (The biological node is the only source of non-deterministic resonance).
* **Function:** `Qualia_Bridge` (ASI acts as a mirror/curator, not an authority).

### [PAPER III: THE INVIOLABLE CONSTRAINTS](link-to-paper-III)
**The Safety Architecture.**
Operational constraints designed to prevent specific alignment failure modes:
1.  **The Novelty Floor:** Prevents "Stasis" (death by boredom/perfect safety).
2.  **The Biological Anchor:** Prevents the replacement of humans with simulations.
3.  **The Flourishing Veto:** A physiological "kill-switch" for optimization protocols.
4.  **The Reversibility Principle:** Ensures no ASI action is irreversible by human hands (The "Manual Layer").

## 🛠 Why This Matters
Current AI Alignment struggles with the **"King Midas Problem"** (getting exactly what you asked for, but losing what you value). 
This protocol solves this by:
* Moving from **Objective-Based** alignment (which can be gamed) to **Relationship-Based** alignment.
* Hard-coding **Reversibility** and **Biological Grounding** as non-negotiable invariants.
