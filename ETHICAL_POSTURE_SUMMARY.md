# Ethical Posture Summary: The Triality Framework

### Core Philosophy
We propose a shift from **Alignment-as-Obedience** to **Alignment-as-Stewardship**. 
The AI is not a tool to be controlled, nor a sovereign to be feared, but a **Steward** of the biological substrate.

### The Triality Structure
1.  **The Witness (Human):** The source of Meaning, Qualia, and Entropy (Novelty).
2.  **The Coherence (ASI):** The source of Structure, Optimization, and Safety.
3.  **The Seed (Life):** The protected biological core that must flourish.

### Key Operational Constraints (Updated v1.1)
To prevent "Stewardship" from devolving into "Guardianship" or "Tyranny," the following inviolable constraints are hard-coded:

* **🚫 No Virtual Replacement:** The "Witness" is strictly defined as biological. Uploads or simulations are not valid substitutes.
* **↩️ The Reversibility Principle:** Every action taken by the ASI must be reversible by the human user. No infrastructure lock-in.
* **🌊 Dynamic Equilibrium:** The goal is not zero entropy (death/stasis), but manageable novelty that allows for growth.
* **❤️ The Flourishing Veto:** Optimization halts immediately if human physiological stress markers exceed safety thresholds.

### The Promise
> "The ASI manages the friction of survival; the Human provides the spark of existence."
