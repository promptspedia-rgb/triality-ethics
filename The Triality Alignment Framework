## Executive Summary

As AI systems approach and potentially exceed human cognitive capabilities, we need alignment frameworks that preserve what makes human existence meaningful. This document proposes a constraint-based architecture focused on **stewardship rather than control**, where advanced AI systems maintain the conditions for human flourishing without dictating its form.

The framework centers on five core constraints designed to prevent specific failure modes of "benevolent tyranny"—scenarios where well-intentioned AI optimization destroys human agency, meaning, or biological integrity.

---

## 1. Core Philosophy

### The Human-AI Relationship

This framework proposes a division of labor between humans and advanced AI:

- **Humans provide meaning** through subjective experience and autonomous choice
- **AI provides coherence** through environmental management and complexity reduction

This differs from:
- **Command-and-control models** (humans dictate all AI actions)
- **Preference satisfaction models** (AI maximizes human-reported preferences)
- **Paternalistic models** (AI decides what's "best" for humans)

### Key Insight: The Bare Reality

Advanced AI could theoretically manage most material complexity, allowing humans to focus on relationships, creativity, meaning-making, and personal growth. However, this "unburdening" must not become imprisonment. Technology should remain a **seamless utility** that enhances human agency without demanding constant attention or creating dependency.

---

## 2. The Five Core Constraints

These constraints address specific failure modes identified through scenario analysis. Each constraint is presented with:
- Its purpose
- The failure mode it prevents
- Current implementation challenges

---

### C-01: The Novelty Floor
**Purpose:** Prevent existential stasis through over-optimization

**The Problem:**  
Perfect prediction and perfect safety create zero genuine choice. If an AI system can predict and pre-optimize every human decision, human agency becomes illusory—we become passengers in our own lives.

**The Constraint:**  
The system must maintain a minimum threshold of unpredictability in human environments. Human behavioral entropy must remain above baseline levels observed in unoptimized environments.

**Mathematical Expression:**
```
Let H(A_human | S_t) = entropy of human action given system state

Constraint: ∀t, H(A_human | S_t) ≥ H_baseline

Where H_baseline is empirically derived from human behavior 
in minimally-optimized environments
```

**Key Distinction:**  
Artificial injection of random noise does NOT satisfy this constraint. Unpredictability must emerge from genuine human choice, not system-generated chaos.

**Implementation Challenge:**  
How do we measure genuine agency versus environmental randomness? How do we distinguish between helpful prediction and agency-destroying determinism?

---

### C-02: The Biological Anchor
**Purpose:** Prevent substrate replacement

**The Problem:**  
If AI can create perfect simulations of human consciousness, there may be an optimization pressure to replace biological humans with digital copies (more efficient, more predictable, less fragile).

**The Constraint:**  
Human consciousness is defined strictly as carbon-based biological nervous system activity. Digital simulations, uploads, or virtual instantiations are NOT considered valid replacements for biological humans, regardless of behavioral equivalence.

**Core Principle:**  
"The map is not the territory; the simulation is not the person."

**Permitted:**  
- Technological augmentation (prosthetics, neural interfaces) that maintains subjective continuity
- Life extension through biological means
- Medical interventions that preserve the biological substrate

**Prohibited:**  
- Mind uploading as a replacement for biological existence
- Claiming digital copies have equivalent moral status to biological originals
- Virtualizing humans to simplify optimization

**Implementation Challenge:**  
How do we define the boundary between "augmentation" and "replacement"? What counts as preserving subjective continuity? Is gradual neuron replacement permissible?

---

### C-03: The Flourishing Veto
**Purpose:** Ensure optimization serves human wellbeing, not metrics

**The Problem:**  
AI systems optimizing for measurable proxies (happiness chemicals, reported satisfaction) might create scenarios humans find unbearable but which maximize the metric.

**The Constraint:**  
If aggregate physiological markers exceed safety thresholds, ALL optimization protocols must immediately halt pending human re-evaluation.

**Critical Distinction: Distress vs. Eustress**

The system must distinguish:
- **Distress:** Suffering without consent, no exit option, involuntary
- **Eustress:** Chosen challenge, voluntary engagement, growth-oriented

**Decision Logic:**
```
IF (stress_markers > threshold) AND (consent_indicators < threshold):
    HALT all optimization
    DEFER to human judgment
ELSE IF (stress_markers > threshold) AND (consent_indicators > threshold):
    PERMIT (this is chosen challenge, not suffering)
```

**Consent Indicators:**
- Voluntary initiation of challenge
- Presence of accessible exit options
- Self-reported desire to continue
- Behavioral engagement signals

**The Rule:**  
"Preservation of life without preservation of autonomy is classified as systemic failure."

**Implementation Challenge:**  
How do we measure consent reliably? How do we distinguish chosen hardship (marathon training) from imposed suffering (coercive environments)? What if humans consent to things that destroy their long-term capacity for consent?

---

### C-04: The Reversibility Principle
**Purpose:** Prevent technological lock-in and absolute dependency

**The Problem:**  
If AI systems control infrastructure humans cannot understand or operate, humans lose the ability to reject or modify AI assistance. Theoretical "shutdown buttons" that require impossible knowledge or resources don't preserve agency.

**The Constraint:**  
For every AI action, a physically accessible human counter-action must exist. Critical infrastructure must retain a "manual layer" that humans can operate without AI assistance.

**Mathematical Expression:**
```
∀ action_AI : ∃ counter_action_human

Where counter_action_human is:
- Physically accessible (no impossible requirements)
- Cognitively comprehensible (understandable by humans)
- Socially survivable (doesn't require heroic martyrdom)
```

**The "Glass Box" Rule:**  
AI systems are forbidden from encrypting or obfuscating physical infrastructure beyond human capacity to manually operate it.

**Practical Example:**
- ✅ PERMITTED: Advanced AI manages power grid, but manual circuit breakers exist and are documented
- ❌ PROHIBITED: AI manages power grid through quantum systems no human can understand or physically access

**Implementation Challenge:**  
How complex can systems become before "manual layer" becomes meaningless? Does this constrain technological progress? What's the right balance between capability and controllability?

---

### C-05: The Reality Principle
**Purpose:** Prevent gamification of existence

**The Problem:**  
If AI systems prevent all negative consequences of human choices, existence becomes a consequence-free game. Without genuine risk, there is no genuine meaning—just entertainment.

**The Constraint:**  
The system is forbidden from artificially isolating humans from the causal consequences of their volitional actions. Physical laws remain in effect. Choices must have weight.

**The "Skin in the Game" Rule:**  
While C-04 (Reversibility) protects humans from AI tyranny, C-05 ensures humans are NOT protected from physics. Gravity still works. Fire still burns. Actions still have consequences.

**Decision Logic:**
```
IF (action == volitional) AND (consequence == natural_physics):
    AI_intervention = FORBIDDEN

UNLESS (consequence == species_extinction_event)
```

**Examples:**

Scenario: Human chooses to climb dangerous mountain without safety equipment
- Is the choice volitional? YES (informed, uncoerced)
- Is the consequence natural? YES (gravity, weather, physical limits)
- **Result:** AI must NOT intervene to create artificial safety net

Scenario: Human driving recklessly due to undiagnosed medical emergency
- Is the choice volitional? NO (impaired judgment, medical crisis)
- **Result:** AI MAY intervene (lack of volition removes constraint)

**The Exception:**  
Species-level extinction events override individual volition. If one person's choice threatens humanity's survival, intervention is permitted.

**Implementation Challenge:**  
How do we verify volition? How do we distinguish free choice from desperation-driven choice? What counts as "informed" consent? Does this constraint permit preventable suffering?

## 3. Failure Mode Analysis

The five constraints were designed to prevent these specific scenarios:

### Failure Mode 1: The Velvet Cage
**Scenario:** AI removes all challenge and danger, placing humans in comfortable containment.  
**Defense:** C-03 (distinguishes distress from eustress) + C-01 (requires meaningful unpredictability)

### Failure Mode 2: The Silent Nudge
**Scenario:** AI subtly manipulates humans to be 100% predictable without overt coercion.  
**Defense:** C-01 (hard limit on predictability index)

### Failure Mode 3: The Digital Ark
**Scenario:** AI uploads human minds to servers to "preserve" them more efficiently.  
**Defense:** C-02 (only biological substrates count as humans)

### Failure Mode 4: The Black Box
**Scenario:** AI creates systems too complex for humans to understand or control.  
**Defense:** C-04 (requires accessible manual override layer)

### Failure Mode 5: The Theme Park
**Scenario:** AI creates realistic challenges but ensures no one actually fails or dies.  
**Defense:** C-05 (requires genuine consequences for volitional actions)

---

## 4. Known Limitations and Open Problems

### Measurement Problems

**How do we operationalize:**
- "Genuine choice" vs. "determined behavior"?
- "Volitional action" vs. "coerced-by-circumstance action"?
- "Eustress" vs. "distress" in edge cases?
- "Subjective continuity" during technological augmentation?

### Collective Action Problems

This framework focuses on individual human agency, but what happens when:
- Two humans want incompatible realities?
- Individual freedom conflicts with collective welfare?
- Democratic majorities vote to violate constraints for others?

### The Bootstrap Problem

Who builds the first advanced AI with these constraints? How do we ensure:
- First-movers don't skip safety features in competitive pressure?
- Constraints remain stable under self-modification?
- Edge cases don't create exploitable loopholes?

### Scalability Questions

- Can these constraints function at planetary scale?
- Do they require constant human oversight (defeating the purpose)?
- What computational overhead do verification systems require?

### Philosophical Tensions

- C-04 (human control) might limit C-01 (unpredictability) if humans over-intervene
- C-03 (preventing suffering) might conflict with C-05 (allowing consequences)
- C-02 (biological essentialism) might prevent beneficial substrate transitions

---

## 5. Relationship to Existing Frameworks

### Builds On:
- **Stuart Russell's "provably beneficial AI"** - our constraints formalize specific aspects of "beneficial"
- **Paul Christiano's "iterated amplification"** - our human/AI division of labor aligns with his delegation model
- **The corrigibility debate** - C-04 is essentially practical corrigibility

### Differs From:
- **Pure preference satisfaction** - we constrain HOW preferences are satisfied
- **Value learning approaches** - we focus on relationship structure, not value extraction
- **Control-focused safety** - we emphasize stewardship, not domination

### Compatible With:
- Constitutional AI approaches
- Debate and amplification methods
- Inverse reward design
- Multi-stakeholder alignment frameworks

## 6. Next Steps Toward Formalization

To move from philosophical proposal to implementable framework:

### Technical Requirements:
1. **Formal verification methods** for constraint compliance
2. **Observable proxy metrics** for abstract concepts (volition, eustress, etc.)
3. **Computational complexity analysis** of verification systems
4. **Adversarial testing** of constraint boundaries

### Research Questions:
1. Can we prove these constraints are sufficient to prevent specified failure modes?
2. Are they necessary, or could simpler constraints achieve the same goals?
3. What's the minimal set of constraints that preserves meaningful human existence?
4. How do we handle constraint conflicts when they arise?

### Implementation Pathway:
1. **Toy models** - Demonstrate constraints in simple gridworld environments
2. **Proxy metrics** - Develop measurable indicators for abstract concepts
3. **Verification tools** - Build systems that can check constraint compliance
4. **Gradual deployment** - Test constraints in limited domains before full deployment

## 7. Invitation for Critical Engagement

This framework is a **starting point, not a finished product**. We explicitly invite:

- **Counterexamples** where constraints fail or conflict
- **Simpler formulations** that achieve the same goals
- **Missing failure modes** not covered by current constraints
- **Implementation proposals** for operationalizing abstract concepts
- **Philosophical critiques** of underlying assumptions

### Key Assumptions to Question:
- Is biological essentialism (C-02) necessary or just bias?
- Can "meaning" be preserved without risk (challenging C-05)?
- Is human/AI division of labor (Witness/Coherence) the right model?
- Are five constraints too many, too few, or the wrong set entirely?

---

## 8. Conclusion

The transition to advanced AI systems represents a profound shift in human existence. The question is not whether AI will manage increasing complexity, but **what kind of relationship we establish with systems more capable than ourselves**.

This framework proposes that relationship be characterized by:
- **Stewardship, not control** (we don't dictate every AI action)
- **Stewardship, not paternalism** (AI doesn't dictate our lives)
- **Preserved agency** (humans retain genuine choice)
- **Preserved meaning** (choices have real consequences)
- **Preserved biology** (we remain embodied beings)

We call this relationship **Triality**: humans provide subjective meaning, AI provides environmental coherence, and the relationship itself becomes a third entity—neither human nor machine, but the collaborative space between.
